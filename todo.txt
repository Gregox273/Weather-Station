- Make sure database is unlocked upon exit!
- Make sure logging does not hog the database if continuously logging (e.g. from an sd dump). Also make sure export database locks database for minimum time
- Logs tab to search through database for events and/or logged packets (similar to raw terminal)
    - Maybe replace terminal tab so that sd dump doesn't slow down the gui
- Plot uv power as well as index
- Refresh button for historic view
- The other graphs
- Stop live transmit on gui exit
- y axis labels
- Arduino does not reliably respond to commands?

- Test everything!
